## FitDensity.jl
The scripts creates training data of a discrete field theory (discrete wave equation). Based on the training data it learns a model of discrete Lagrangian density.

## Evaluation_Trained_Model.ipynb
Jupyter notebook containing numerical experiments with a machine learned discrete density on data of the discrete wave equation. Prediction accuracy is assessed and travelling waves are detected and compared to a reference.
